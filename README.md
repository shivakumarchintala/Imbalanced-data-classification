# unbalanced-data-classification
Machine Learning Project on Imbalanced Data 
here the aim is to predict a binary class which is imbalanced 
94% of target variable is filled with -5000 and 6% of target variable is filled with 5000
this are converted to {-5000:0,5000:1}
like wise 0's and 1's
auc score after applying the smote technique is 0.77 before it is 0.66.
